Platform on which developed and tested:
Linux

Time spent in total:
35 Hours

Difficulties faced:
1) One of the biggest hurdle that we faced during this assignment was understanding the use and the flow of SIGALRM.
2) Another difficulty we faced was ensuring that the server handles Socerer's Apprentice Syndrome and testing for the same.

Helpful Remarks:
1) Run the server to get the port number.
2) Use the port number in tftp client to connect to the server.
3) Set tftp client to binary mode.
4) Use get and put commands to send and receive files from the server.
5) Can check for concurrency by running multiple tftp clients and connecting them to the above mentioned port.
